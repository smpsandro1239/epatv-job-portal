EPATV Job Portal üöÄ

The EPATV Job Portal is a web-based platform designed for Escola Profissional Amar Terra Verde (EPATV) to connect ex-students (alumni) with job opportunities posted by companies. Built with Laravel 12, it offers a robust backend with MySQL, role-based access control, and automated notifications. The frontend uses Laravel Blade with Tailwind CSS. The system supports three primary user types: superadmin (school administration), employers (companies), and students (ex-students/alumni), with features like temporary registration windows, job filtering, and an analytics dashboard.
üéØ Features
üë• User Types and Roles

**Superadmin (School Administration):**
*   Manages users (including approving pending registrations), overall system settings like registration windows, and has oversight of platform activity via the dashboard. Job postings themselves are directly managed by companies/employers.
*   Approves registrations outside the defined time window.
*   Accesses a dashboard with metrics (e.g., total users, jobs, applications).

**Employers (Companies/Admins):**
*   Register with company details (contact person name, company name, city, website, logo, etc.).
*   Create and manage job postings (CRUD).
*   View and manage applications received for their jobs.

**Students (Ex-Students/Alumni):**
*   Initial registration with core details (name, email, password, role, and course completion year if applicable). Additional details like phone, CV, photo, and areas of interest are completed via the student's profile management section after registration.
*   Browse, filter, and apply to job listings.
*   Save jobs for later viewing.
*   Receive notifications for new jobs in their interest areas.
*   Track application history and status.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionalities

**Registration Window:**
*   Students register within a time window (e.g., start/end datetime) set by the superadmin.
*   Window can have a maximum number of registrations (0 for unlimited).
*   Optional password protection for the window. Password-based registration allows a set number of registrations within a configurable duration (e.g., 2 hours) from the first time the password is used.
*   Out-of-window (time, capacity, or password validation failure) registrations are marked as 'pending', notifying the superadmin and the student.

**Job Postings:**
*   Companies create listings with title, area of interest, description, location, salary, contract type, and expiration date.
*   Public job board with filters for area of interest, location, and contract type.
*   Detailed view for each job.

**Applications:**
*   Students apply via an API endpoint, potentially with a cover letter.
*   Companies view applications with candidate details (name, email, phone, CV link).
*   Students can view their application history and status.

**Notifications (Database-driven):**
*   Students receive notifications for new jobs posted in their selected areas of interest.
*   Superadmins and students are notified when a student's registration is 'pending'.
*   Students are notified when their pending registration is approved.
*   Users can view their notifications and mark them as read (individually or all).

**Admin Dashboard:**
*   Displays key metrics: total users (by role), pending registrations, CV uploads, total jobs, total applications.
*   Includes charts (Chart.js) for: jobs by location, jobs by area of interest, jobs by month, and jobs by contract type.
*   Superadmin manages registration window settings.

**Security:**
*   Role-based access control via Laravel middleware.
*   Laravel Sanctum for API authentication (if used, default is session/JWT for API in this project).
*   Secure file uploads (CVs, photos, logos; max 2MB) with validation.
