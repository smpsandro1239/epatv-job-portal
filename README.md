EPATV Job Portal üöÄ

The EPATV Job Portal is a web-based platform designed for Escola Profissional Amar Terra Verde (EPATV) to connect ex-students (alumni) with job opportunities posted by companies. Built with Laravel 12, it offers a robust backend with MySQL, role-based access control, and automated notifications. The frontend uses Laravel Blade with Tailwind CSS, with optional WordPress integration (e.g., via Elementor). The system supports three user types: superadmin (school administration), admins (companies), and ex-students, with features like temporary registration windows, job filtering, and an analytics dashboard.
üéØ Features
üë• User Types and Roles

Password-based registration allows 30 registrations within 2 hours from first use.
Out-of-window registrations are marked as pending, notifying superadmin and student.
